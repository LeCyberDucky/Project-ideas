- App launch silencer 2.0 (easily adaptable to new programs)
- Command line tool to merge PDF files (either a given list, or all files in the directory)
  - Perhaps combine Rust and Python for this? Rust for the command line interface, Python for working with PDFs. Good for learning how to combine the two
- Tool that lets you use a laptop (maybe even a phone) as a second screen for another computer and allows for touch-input

- Simple compose key program (like [WinCompose](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose))

- Kotlin sporty app

- WYSIWYG math editor
  - Typing equations like in word and LaTeX
  - No waiting for slow LaTeX compilation
  - Functionality from programming (defining expressions as a variable, using that variable in an expression, and be able to expand it)
  - Sympy simplification backend?
  - Ability to export to useful formats 


### Stuff using the windows crate
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows
